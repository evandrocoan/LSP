=> 0.7.1

WARNING: You will likely have to "enable" your langauge server.

This was a breaking change in 0.7.0 that was not identified / called out.
As the default configurations declare overlapping support for file types, default-disabled
was adopted.

Changes in this minor update:
* Prevent sublime lockups by moving server writes to dedicated thread (@Kronuz)
* Handle windows URIs where the ':' is unnecessarily encoded (file:///C%3A/file.txt)
* Add tcp_host setting for connecting to remote tcp server
* Fix major bug parsing client configs (@randy3k)

See https://github.com/tomv564/LSP/releases/tag/0.7.1 for full update details.
